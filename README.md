# ✨ Daemira

**Daemira** a personal system daemon — local command-and-control interface for running automation tasks on my machine.

It runs in the background, listens for instructions, and executes defined commands. I use it to centralize scripts, state, and routines I want to access through either the terminal or remote triggers.
